# Website paths

This repository is a website hosted from the `docs` directory using GitHub Pages. The purpose of the website is to investigate how relative paths work for page links, image files, and CSS files when using GitHub Pages from the `docs` directory in a project repository. View the website at https://gavinw.me/website-paths/.

The website is evaluated using three approaches:

- On a local computer by opening the `index.html` file in a web browser 💻
- Running a local Python server to open the `index.html` file in a web browser 🗄️
- Hosting the site via GitHub Pages from the `docs` directory 🌎

When viewing the website, the 💻, 🗄️, and 🌎 symbols represent the path that worked for that approach.
